Workflows
=========

This section introduces the basic steps for various workflows
supported by SimplyFire.

Detailed description of each plugin can be found in the :doc:`plugins_gui` section.

All GUI-based plugins are hidden by default.
To make them visible, go to ``Plug-ins`` menu -> click on the
desired plugin name.
Plugins that require user-input will typically have a form appear
in the **control-panel**, located on the left-hand side of the application.

Use the tabs in the **control-panel** to navigate between various plugins.
